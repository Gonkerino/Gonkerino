## 👋 Hey, I'm Malcolm (He/Him)

I'm a current MSc student in Computational Mathematical Finance (Machine Learning Focus) at The University of Edinburgh, having already graduated with an MPhys in Mathematical Physics from Heriot-Watt University.

I thrive at the intersection of mathematics, optimisation and problem solving, and have a specific interest in optimal decisions in the face of uncertainty. The quantitative skills developed from my mathematical physics background translate very naturally to problems in finance where quantitative research, stochastic methods, high-dimensional optimisation and computational methods have taken my recent interest

### I'm Currently Reading:
- "Deep Learning Calibration Framework for Detecting Asset Price Bubbles from Option Prices" [Manish Arora PhD Thesis - March 2025]: [https://theses.gla.ac.uk/85088/1/2025AroraPhD.pdf]
- "Signature Methods in Finance - An Introduction with Computational Applications" [Gonçalo dos Reis et al]: [https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-97239-3]
- "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" [Burton G. Malkiel]: [https://rybn.org/ANTI/ARTICLES/1973-Burton%20G.%20Malkiel-A%20Random%20Walk%20Down%20Wall%20Street.pdf]

### Previous Roles @ STMicroelectronics (2024): Optical Engineering R&D Intern
- Worked on simulation, modelling, and optimisation of next-generation SPAD Time-of-Flight sensors using FDTD, Bayesian optimisation, and statistical analysis.
- Ran large-scale FDTD simulations and optical characterisation to improve SPAD quantum efficiency.
- Designed and optimised new pixel/optical-stack topologies under BEOL/DRC + fill-factor constraints.
- Built a high-dimensional Bayesian Optimisation framework + multi-objective search integrating MATLAB/Python + scripted FDTD runs → ~60% faster convergence than manual/grid sweeps.
- Developed a 99.7%-accurate regression/anomaly-detection model, reducing 60+ device metrics to 7 engineered features and revealing key physics differences vs legacy designs.
- Contributed to patent-pending optimisation and modelling methods.
